# -Development-of-an-Expert-System-for-Waste-Recycling-using-Machine-Learning-methods
Proper waste recycling is essential for protecting the environment and conserving natural resources. However, many people face confusion regarding the types of materials that can be recycled and the correct ways to manage waste. Therefore, we decided to develop an expert system for recycling, combining the CLIPS library and machine learning in Matlab.

The CLIPS library is used to implement the logic for waste management. It allows defining rules for managing different types of waste, rules for sorting, and even rules for rewarding individuals who recycle. In the Matlab program, we employed a machine learning algorithm to identify different categories of waste from images. The classification results are written to a text file, which is then used by CLIPS to create the necessary fact base. This system helps increase recycling efficiency and promotes a cleaner environment.
